Fundamentals of Analytics Modeling

-focusing on Predictive Analytics

Background:
-install R programming (to generate graphs)

What is Analytical Application (Modeling)? 

We cannot make decisions without a source data. If the raw data is not useful, it must be manipulated in order to come up with the best output. Convert the raw data into information.

Benefits:
competitive advantage

We will not be the users, but the developers (of apps like Tableau)

improve customer experience

At the end of this course, the latest trends will be learned


For next meeting, make sure to install R programming.

Analytics
-the discover, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in data
-especially valuable in areas rich with recorded information
-relies on the simultaneous application of statistics, computer programming and operations research to quantigy performance
-often favors data visualization to communicate insight
-applied in businessses to describe, predict, and improve business performance

Types of Analytics
-Decision Analytics
-Descriptive Analytics
-Diagnostic Analytics
-Predictive Analytics (to be focused on)
-Prescriptive Analytics

---

Decision Analytics
-a systematic, quantitive, and visual approach to making strategic business decisions
-uses a variety of tools and also incorporates aspects of psychology, management techniques, and economics
-often used to assess decisions that are made in the context of multiple variables and that have many possible outcomes or objectives
-NOTE: can easily lead to analysis paralysis and, due to information overload, the inability to make a decision at all

-Decisions Tree (chart)

-A real eastate development company is deciding on whether to build on a new shopping center in a location
-They might examine several pieces of input to aid in their decision-making process
	traffic at the proposed location on various days of the week at different times
	the popularity of similar shopping xenters in the area
	financial demographics
	local competition
	preferred shopping habits of the area population

Descriptive Analytics

-the most basic and widely used type of analytics that companies use
-the examination of data or content, usually manually performed, to answer the question "What happened?" (or What is happening?)
-used to produce reports, key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics that enable companies to track performance and other trends
-summarizes and highlights patterns in current and historical data
-characterized by traditional business integliigence (BI_ and visualizations such as pie charts, bar charts, line graphs, tables, or generated narratives

-Companies use this to evaluate how well they are operating and whether they are on track to attain business goals
	Business leaders and financial specialists = track common fincial metrics such as quarterly growth in revenue and expenses
	Marketing teams - track compaign performance by monitoring metrics like conversion rates and the number of social media followers
	Manufacturing groups = moniter metrics like production line throughput and downtine
-How metrics are used
	Reports (highlight aspects of business performance)
	Visualizations (charts to communicate their impact to a wider audience)
	Dashboards (visualiations to track progress = quicker to view/absorb)

---
Diagnostic Analytics
-looks at why things happened

---
Predictive Analytics
-lecerages historical data to predict what could happen in the future
-It forecasts the probablity and potential impact of specific future outcomes, helping business leaders take a more proactive, data-driven approach to decision-making
-Organizations can use predictive analytics to foresee the potential impact of problems
-Example: supply chain analytics can help identify supply chain risks and potential future issues

-uses the results of descriptive, diagnostic and predictive analytics to suggest actions that businesses can take to influence future outcomes
