Why Software Engineering is Essential
- We can't run the modern world without software.

Software systems are abstract and intangible
- They are not constrained.

However, software systems can quickly become extremely complex, difficult to understand, and expensive to change.

Not all softwares need the same software engineering techniques

Software is not just another word for computer program


Software Products
- Generic products
- Customized (or bespoke) products

Attributes of a good software

Maintainability
Dependability and security
Efficiency
Acceptability

What is software engineering?
