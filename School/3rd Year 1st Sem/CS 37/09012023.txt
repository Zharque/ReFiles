-just like driving directions

Terminology
agent - entity that perceives its environment and acts upon that environment
state - a configuration of the agent and its environment
initial state - 
actions - choices that can be made in a state
ACTIONS(s) - returns the set of actions that can be executed in state s
transition model - a description of what state results from performing any applicable action in any state
RESULT(s,a) - returns the state resulting from performing action a in state s
state space - the set of all states reachable from the initial state by any sequence of actions
goal test - way to determine whether a given state is a goal state
path cost - numerical cost associated with a given path

Search Problems

-initial state
-actions
-transitional model
-goal test
-path cost function

optimal solution - a solution that has the lowest path cost among all solutions

node
a data structure that keeps track of 
-a state
-a parent (node that generated this node)
-an action (action applied to parent to get node)
-a path cost (from initial state to node)

Aprroach
starts with a frontier that contains the initial state
Repeat: 
-if the frontier is empty, then no solution
-removve a node from the frontier
-if node contains goal state, return the solution
-Expand node, add resulting nodes to the frontier

Revised Approach
Start with a frontier that contains the initial state
Start with an empty explored set
Repeat:
-if the frontier is empty, then no solution
-remove a node from the frontier
-if node contains goal state, return the solution
-add the node to the explored set***
-expand node, add resulting nodes to the frontier if thet aren't already in the frontier or the explored set

stack - last-in first-out data type

Depth-First Search
deepest first in the frontier

Breadth-First Search
search algorithm that always expands the shallowest node in the frontier
-uses a queue (first-in first-out data type)

uninformed search
-search strategy that uses no problem-specific knowledge

informed search
-search strategy that uses problem-specific knowledge to find solutions more efficiently

greedy best-first search
-search algorithm that expands the node that is closest to the goal, as estimated by a heuristic function h(n)

A* search

search algorithm that expands node with lowest balue of g(n) + h(n)

g(n) = cost to reach node
h(n) = estimated cost to goal

Adveservial Search

Minimax

MAX (x) aims to maximize score
MIN (O) aims to minimize score

S0: initial state
Player(s): returns which player to move in state s
Actions(s): returns legal moves in state s
Result(s, a): returns state after action a taken in state s
Terminal(s): checks if state s is a terminal state
Utility(s): final numerical value for terminal state s
