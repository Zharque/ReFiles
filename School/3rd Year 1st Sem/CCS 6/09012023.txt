Introduction to Systems

System (definitions)
-a regularly interacting group of elements forming a unified whole
-a collection of related parts treated as a unit where its components interact
-a group of related procedures for a particular business function such as inventory or payroll
-a group of interrelated procedures used for a business function, with an identifiable boundary, working together for some purpose

Information System
-a collection of people, procedures, programs, equipment and methods that process data and make it available

------------------
PARTS OF A SYSTEM

The Environment
-The people, facilities, rules, policies, and regulations that surround a system
-Systems exist in relation to other systems and to the outside world

Libary System
==============
Books, Librarians, Borrowers, Library rules and regulations

Boundery
-The perimeter, or line of demarcation between a system and the environment

Inputs
-Items that enter the bounderies of the system from the environment and are manipulated

Processing
-The conversion of inputs, or raw materials, to outputs, or finished results

Outputs
-The product of processing
-can be hardcopy or softcopy

Information

Hardware

Software
-system software
-application software
-in-house applications, software packages, legacy systems

Data
-consists of basic facts that are the system's raw material

Procedures
-defined tasts that must be performed by people

People
-users
-skilled processionals

OTHER SYSTEM CONCEPTS

Decomposition
-The process of breaking down a system into its smaller components

Modularity
-the direct result of decomposition
-dividing a system into chunks or modules of a relatively uniform size
-modules can represent a system simply
-helps the designer to compartmentalize the design into functional compartments

Coupling
-means the extent to which subsystems depend on each other
-subsystems should be as independent as possible
-if one subsystem fails and other subsystems are highly dependent on it, the others will either fail themselves or have problems functioning
-when designing, you must strive for low coupling (dependency between modules should be less)

Cohesion
-the extent to which a system or subsystem performs a single function
-when designing, you must strive for high cohesion (a cohesive module focuses on a single task with little interaction with other modules)

--------------
Systems that the systems analyst recommends, designs and maintains for users

----
The Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

1. Identifying problems, opportunities, and objectives
2. Determining human information requirements
3. Analyzing system needs
4. Designing the recommended system
5. Developing and documenting software
6. Testing and maintaining the system
7. Implementing and evaluating the system

Phase 1:
Identifying problems, opportunities and objectives
Activities:
-interviewing user management
-summarizing the knowledge obtained
-estimating the scope of the project
-documenting the results
Output/Milestone:
-feasibility report containing problem definition and obective summaries from which management can make a decision on whether or not to proceed with the proposed project

Phase 2:
Determining human information requirements 
Activities:
-Interviewing
-Sampling and investing hard data
-Questionnaires
-Observe the decision maker's behavior and environment
-Prototyping
-Learn the who, what, where, when, how, and why of the current system

Phase 3:
Activities
-Create data flow diagrams (DFD)
-complete the data dictionary
Output:
-reccomendation

Phase 4:
Designing the reccomended system
Activites:
-design procedures for data entry
-design the human-computer interface
output
-model of the actual system

Phase 5:

Phase 6:
Testing and maintaining the system

Phase 7:
Implementing and evaluating the System

The Impact of Maintenance
-Some reasearchers estiamte that the amount of time spent on system maintenance may be as much as 60% of the total time spent on systems projects
-removing software errors
-enhancing existing software
