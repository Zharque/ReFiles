A database has five transactions. Let min_sup = 60% and min_conf = 80%.

min_sup = 60% of 5 transactions
min_sup = 3


-
Assuming a min. confidence of 80%, the final set of rules reported by Apriori are:
{E,O} -> {K}
{O,K} -> {E}
{O} -> {E,K}
{E} -> {K}
{K} -> {E}

{O} -> {E}
{O} -> {K}
{M} -> {K}
{Y} -> {K}
