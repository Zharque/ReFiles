Good evening sir, we've made changes to our business rules and came up with this ERD:

*image*

Our new business rules are the following:

1.One member reserves zero or more instruments.
One instrument is reserved to zero or more members.

Unlike our previous business rule 1 where it was a ternary rule along with 'Request', we no longer have an entity Request. Instead, the many-to-many relationship between 'Member' and 'Instrument' creates the binary associative entity 'Reservation'.

2.One user cancels zero or more reservations.
One reservation is canceled by zero or one user.

This is the same with our previous rule 2, however we are no longer using 'Request' but instead the associative entity 'Reservation'.

3. One manager confirms zero or more reservations.
One reservation is confirmed by zero or one manager.

The manager will be approving the reservation of the instrument on the day that the member claims the instrument. The payment will also be taken.
If the start date has passed but the instrument has not been claimed, then the reservation will be canceled through business rule 2.

4.One manager ends zero or more reservations.
One reservation is ended by one manager.

Once the end date of the reservation has arrived, the manager will confirm the retrieval of the instrument by ending the reservation.

We'd like to ask for guidance if our current business rules and ERD has been properly made and if there are adjustments that we need to make. Thank you sir.
